This project is a simple travel journal app that displays trip entries. Each entry includes an image, country name, Google Maps link, title, trip dates, and description. The Entry component receives data as props and displays it. The App component maps through journalData and passes the data to multiple Entry components. I learned how to pass and receive props in React, use the spread operator ({...data}) to pass all properties at once, and structure components for reusability.
